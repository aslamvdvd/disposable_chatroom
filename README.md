In this platform the users can create disposable chatrooms.
Interface will be really simple and users can click on the button given in the platform to make the chatroom and then invite people to it.
no need to have an account and they can just login using there name (its a thought but u think that having an account is a plus, and we can make the method of making an account easier.)
people can invite each other via qr codes, invitation code, links etc.
people can also add users from their contacts.

i havent thought about it much but why would anyone want to use this platform when their are literally hundreds or more choices out there. i have to think on it.
